                            <p>Below are our Terms of Service, which outline a lot of legal goodies, but the bottom line
                                is it’s our aim to always take care of both you, as a customer, or as a seller on our
                                platform. We’ve included many of these terms to legally protect ourselves, but if you
                                have an issue, always feel free to email us at support@reviewx.com and we’ll do our
                                best to resolve it in a fair and timely fashion.</p>
